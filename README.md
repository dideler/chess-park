Networked multiplayer chess in your browser.

Inspired by another project of mine,
[Basic Browser Chess](https://code.google.com/p/basic-browser-chess/) (BBC).

The plan was to extend BBC and add online multiplayer to it, but we created
a new project instead.

Graham Sharp ([@pounddefine](https://github.com/pounddefine)) wrote the code.
I designed the interface and wrote the [technical paper](report.pdf).

The project was for an introductory networking course; we spent about 3-4 days
on the project.


I just want to try it out!
--------------------------

The easiest way is to download and run the JAR file from our
[release page](https://github.com/dideler/chess-park/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
which also contains instructions on how to get started.

For more detailed information, please do read our fantastic [paper](report.pdf).
