To run the server, open the NetBeans project and build and run the code.
Open a browser and go to your IP address followed by the port number.

For example, if this computer's IP address was 139.57.101.84 then I would direct the
browser to go to 139.57.101.84:22222
You should be redirected to the login page.
To test it across a network, point to the IP address of the host computer and the port
it's using. This will be the same (139.57.101.84:22222).
